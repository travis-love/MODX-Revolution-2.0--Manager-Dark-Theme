MODX-Revolution-2.0-Manager-Dark-Theme
=======================================

MODX Revolution 2.0.0+ Manager Theme - Dark (unofficial)

An unofficial incomplete color change for the MODX manager (and login oddly) for easier reading.

Rename existing files before installing, and future manager updates WILL overwrite these files too.

Install:  
Drag & drop into "manager/templates/default/css/" folder.
